# CMSproject
Here is my CMS project from Computer Science engineering studies
Link: https://odkrywajznami.blog/

This project was creating with another student from university.
The page displays a blog about sports and travels with dropdown-menu with categories, customized logo and favicon, slider with several posts and finally - posts about sports and places to travel! :)
User can give feedback about our blog and see a map of described places.
Language of the page: PL
Contact info's in footer are fictional:)

It was my first page in WP to learn and experiment with CMS technology.
